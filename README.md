# EOType
Magma code for computing Ekedahl-Oort types of curves (function fields) over finite fields


Importing 
---------

To use the code in Magma simply attach the EOType file

> Attach("EOType.mag");

Examples 
--------

The two files 

* ExampleHyperellipticEO.mag 
* ExamplePrym.mag 

contain examples to compute list of EOtypes of curves and Prym varieties respectively 

Documentation
-------------

The documentation is a light (apologies) but included are the slides from a talk I gave on this codebase.
